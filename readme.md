# My unit testing question

Use this repo to examine the two different testing methods. The "node" branch has the Javascript version of the test. The "python" branch has the python version of the branch. Feel free to fork & PR with questions, suggestions or changes.

## Running

### Node
Follow the package.json. First run `npm i` to setup the testing framework. You can then run `npm start` to run the program once at the command line just to verify it's a working app. Then run `npm test` to run the testing suite.

### Python
No dependencies needed for this one. Run `python index.py` to prove it's a working program. Then run `python test_index.py` to run the testing suite.
